## ERP Description
ERP is a type of software system that helps organizations automate and manage core business processes for optimal performance by providing the automation, integration, and intelligence that is essential to efficiently run all the day-to-day business operations.


The simplest way to define ERP is to think about all the core business processes needed to run a company: finance, HR, manufacturing, supply chain, services, Invoices, and others. At its most basic level, ERP helps to efficiently manage all these processes in an integrated system  by coordinating the flow of the data between all of these business processes, providing a single source of truth (central Data-Repository)  and streamlining operations across the enterprise. 


## ERP Components

The System consists of 5 main components/modules . these modules should be able to communicate, share and access information with each other as well as they share the same Database. These modules are :
Finance and Accounting Management (FMS)
Human Resource (HR) 
Supply Chain Management (SCM)
Inventory Management (IM)
